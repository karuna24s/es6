      // Replacing an iife - Immediately-Invoked Function Expression which is a
      // function that runs itself immediately and it creates a scope where
      // nothing is going to leak into it's parent scope (global scope of the window).
      // var name = 'wes';
      // This may work in the console right now but if there are third party javascript
      // name attributes it can get messy so to avoid that you create an iife
      // which is a function that runs immediately and you put your variables inside of that
      // function:
      // (function() {
      //   var name = 'wes';
      //   // if you want to access this variable need to add:
      //   console.log(name);
      // })();
      // Now because of the iife this variable is no longer leaking into the global scope.

      // With let and const variables, we don't need an iife because let and const
      // variables are block scoped.
      // const name = 'wes';

      // If I were to open a set of curly braces and add the const variable in it:
      // {
      //   const name = 'wes';
      // }
      // that is a block and now it is going to be scoped to that block. In the console,
      // if you type in name you will get an empty string. However if you add a console.log(name):
      {
        const name = 'wes';
        console.log(name);
      }
      // the console will return wes. So with let and const you don't need to use an iife.

      // Another problem with var that let and const will solve is with the for loop:
      // for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      //   console.log(i);
      // }
      // In the console, we get 0 through 9. Now problems that arise here are two things:
      // 1. If I type i in the console: it returns 10. So we have global variable that has leaked out
      // into the window or its parent scope which is something necessarily want. i is just
      // a placeholder variable we need inside this loop.
      // 2. Let's say you were doing something inside of this loop: Maybe run something like an
      // AJAX request or add in a setTimeout:
      // for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      //   console.log(i);
      //   setTimeout(function() {
      //     console.log('The number is ' + i);
      //   }, 1000)
      // }
      // So it will run in the console after a second. And all of them is ten because
      // console.log(i) runs immediately and reference whatever i is however after 1
      // second this entire loop has already gone through every iteration that it needs
      // to and the variable i is being overwritten every single time and the problem
      // with that is by the time the first setTimeout runs i variable is already at 10,
      // we don't have any way to reference it. Similarly if you had an AJAX request where
      // you were looping through them there is no good way other than using an iife to
      // reference what that i variable was at the time of running not at the current time.
      // So one quick way we can fix that is change var to let and what we know about let is that
      // let is block scoped.
      for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
        setTimeout(function() {
          console.log('The number is ' + i);
        }, 1000)
      }
      // So now in the console, you will see 0 through 9 and not getting 10 ten times. We are
      // getting as i was declared each and everytime.
