      // Replacing an iife - Immediately-Invoked Function Expression which is a
      // function that runs itself immediately and it creates a scope where
      // nothing is going to leak into it's parent scope (global scope of the window).
      // var name = 'wes';
      // This may work in the console right now but if there are third party javascript
      // name attributes it can get messy so to avoid that you create an iife
      // which is a function that runs immediately and you put your variables inside of that
      // function:
      // (function() {
      //   var name = 'wes';
      //   // if you want to access this variable need to add:
      //   console.log(name);
      // })();
      // Now because of the iife this variable is no longer leaking into the global scope.

      // With let and const variables, we don't need an iife because let and const
      // variables are block scoped.
      const name = 'wes';
