      // We have a whole bunch of new array methods added in ES6. We are going
      // to talk about .from() and .of() first. The reason we are going to
      // talk about these two together is because they both are not not on the
      // prototype. What that means is, if we create a new array like:
      // const ages = [23, 34, 234];
      // and then ages does not have .from () method and it does not have .of
      // howcome? Because they are not on the prototype, they are on the array
      // itself, so there is Array.of(); and Array.from(); What do these do?
      // First thing that they do is that Array.from(); will take something that
      // is array-ish and turn it into a true array. There is a couple of
      // situations where we often need that, and that is when we are working
      // with DOM elements. Let's go ahead and select all the people (all the p
      // tags inside the people div).

      // const people = document.querySelectorAll('.people p');

      // Now let's console.log people and see what we have.
      // console.log(people);
      // So we have all of these people here but it is a nodelist. What if we
      // want an array of these people's names? We could do the following:
      // this map function takes in person and returns person.textContent

      // const peopleArray = Array.from(people);
      // console.log(peopleArray);

      // const names = people.map(person => person.textContent);

      // We get this error that people.map is not a function.
      // Why is that? Lets add a console.log(people) and check what is going on
      // We have a length method, but the prototype is not an array, it is a
      // nodelist. When is something is array-ish or array like and that means
      // that it has a length, which means it is array-ish, it has some of the
      // methods but doesn't have all of the methods that a regular array would
      // have. What we need to do in order to make this map work? We simply would
      // have to make another variable where you make it equal to Array.from
      // method where you pass in the thing that is array like. In this case, it
      // const peopleArray = Array.from()
      // is a nodelist that has a length, so it is being to convert from that to
      // a real one. When I console.log(peopleArray); We still get that error as
      // we did not switch that out. But now the prototype is an array now and
      // you open that all the methods that you are probably used to. You can
      // call Array.from() onto it and then we take this peopleArray and map
      // over that instead of people.

      // const names = peopleArray.map(person => person.textContent);

      // call names in the console and it returns the names array-ish

      // We could have also done this:

      // const people = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.people p'));
      // const names = people.map(person => person.textContent);

      // We could have also done this as well (where Array.from() takes a
      // second argument, which us a map function, which allows us to modify
      // data as we are creating the array.):
      // const people = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.people p'));

      // const people = document.querySelectorAll('.people p');
      // const peopleArray = Array.from(people, person => {
      //   console.log(person);
      //   return person.textContent;
      // });
      // // add a console.log(peopleArray);
      // console.log(peopleArray);

      // Now we are going to comment out this names array because Array.from()
      // will take a second argument which is a map function. I am going to say
      // person and from that we are going to return whatever we want. We add
      // a console.log and it returns Karuna Karuna Karuna.
      // Howcome? Because it loops over every single paragraph tag and then
      // returns to us something. Now what is this person here? Let's console.
      // log it. It returns each p tag. Each person is the actual DOM node,
      // so if we return instead of returning obviously just Karuna, we are
      // going to return person.textContent That should give us the actual
      // person's name. Now the peopleArray = Wes, Kait, Snickers. We created
      // that array in one shot. We don't need the names array, where we have to
      // map it separately because Array.from() will take a second argument,
      // which is the ability to map over it.
      // const names = people.map(person => person.textContent);

      // Another use case is that if we want to convert the arguments object
      // into an actual array. We are going to create a function called sumAll.
      // When we run it, we are going to call sumAll() and pass it a whole bunch
      // of numbers that all need to be added up. We did an example like this
      // where we looped over it. However, if you want to use a reduce one, we
      // are going to figure out how to do that.

      // Inside of this function we are going to console.log(arguments). In the
      // console, we notice that it looks like an array and that would be a
      // perfect use case for reduce. We are going to take arguments and reduce
      // it which will take the previous and next and return the previous +
      // the next. I am going to start with 0. In the console we get the
      // following error, Arguments.reduce is not a function. Why not? If we
      // console.log(arguments); do we see areguments.reduce. Let's checkout the
      // prototype in the console. We don't see the reduce method. Why not?
      // Because this is arguments and it is not an array. It is array-ish. All
      // we would have to do is const nums = Array.from(arguments) and then we
      // use that nums one to reduce on over it and our sumAll. We can call
      // sumAll() in the console and that we get sum of all of over numbers.
      // That is a pretty common use case where you actually want to convert
      // your arguments object on to an array. It is array-ish because it is
      // has a length method but it doesn't have any of the other methods on it.


      function sumAll() {
        // console.log(arguments);
        const nums = Array.from(arguments);
        // return arguments.reduce((prev, next) => prev + next, 0);
        return nums.reduce((prev, next) => prev + next, 0);
      }
      sumAll(2,34,23,234,234,234234,234234,2342);

      // Next up we have Array.of(). Pretty much how it works is you say
      //   const ages = Array.of(); and you pass it as many arguments as you
      // want. That is going to create an array from every single argument you
      // pass it.
      const ages = Array.of(12,4,23,62,34);
      console.log(ages);
      // Returns (5) [12, 4, 23, 62, 34]
