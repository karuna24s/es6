      // We have a whole bunch of new array methods added in ES6. We are going
      // to talk about .from() and .of() first. The reason we are going to
      // talk about these two together is because they both are not not on the
      // prototype. What that means is, if we create a new array like:
      // const ages = [23, 34, 234];
      // and then ages does not have .from () method and it does not have .of
      // howcome? Because they are not on the prototype, they are on the array
      // itself, so there is Array.of(); and Array.from(); What do these do?
      // First thing that they do is that Array.from(); will take something that
      // is array-ish and turn it into a true array. There is a couple of
      // situations where we often need that, and that is when we are working
      // with DOM elements. Let's go ahead and select all the people (all the p
      // tags inside the people div).
      const people = document.querySelectorAll('.people p');
      // Now let's console.log people and see what we have.
      console.log(people);
      // So we have all of these people here but it is a nodelist. What if we
      // want an array of these people's names? We could do the following:
      // this map function takes in person and returns person.textContent
      const names = people.map(person => person.textContent);
      // We get this error that people.map is not a function.
      // Why is that? Lets add a console.log(people) and check what is going on
      // We have a length method, but the prototype is not an array, it is a
      // nodelist.
