      // We will cover some commonly used object literal upgrades. We have an
      // example here, where we have all these variables and want to put them in
      // to an object, where the property names are the same as the variables.
      // So we are going take the property names and place the variables in there.

      const first = 'snickers';
      const last = 'bos';
      const age = 2;
      const breed = 'King Charles Cav';
      // const dog = {
      //   first: first,
      //   last: last,
      //   age: age,
      //   breed: breed,
      // };
      // Now that is ok, but it is very repetitive as we are doing the samething
      // over and over again. We just made an object with all those variables
      // inside of it. If we add a console.log that you will see it is just a
      // regular object.
      // console.log(dog);
      // What we can do is if the property name and the variable you are setting
      // it to are named the exact same thing. You do not need to do this twice.
      // You can take out the variables:
      const dog = {
        firstName = first,
        last,
        age,
        breed,
        pals = ['Hugo, Sunny'],
      };
      console.log(dog);
      // This may look strange because this kind of looks like an array. But it
      // is an object. Doing that still gives the exact same object we are
      // looking for, just without the repetitive property name is equal to the
      // actual variable name. We don't have to go all in on that. That is only
      // when that is the actual case. For example if you want to rename a
      // property to firstName, and the variable could be first. That is no
      // problem there. If you want to add pals, it would an array. You only
      // need to use it when the property name and the variable name are
      // exactly the same.

      // Another upgrade is when you have method definitions inside of an
      // object. Let's say we have a modal object here, so let's call it
      // const modal = {} and inside of that we have three methods. We got
      // create, open and close. All of these are functions in which they are
      // just a function and after each on we have a comma.
      const modal = {
        create: function() {

        },
        open: function() {

        },
        close: function() {

        }
      }
      // Instead of that we can remove the word function and the colon.. that is
      // exact same thing as colon function. It is just a shorthand. There is
      // no weirdness with the keyword this or anything and that is exactly why
      // you should not use an arrow function when you are using a method of an
      // object, because you have this other shorthand here and it is not going
      // to interfere with the scoping of any of your variables or the keyword
      // this. Similarly if you had an params to pass in like maybe selector,
      // content, goodbye. You can pass them in as you normally would into a
      // function.
      const modal = {
        create(selector) {

        },
        open(content) {

        },
        close(goodbye) {

        }
      }
