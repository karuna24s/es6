      // We will cover some commonly used object literal upgrades. We have an
      // example here, where we have all these variables and want to put them in
      // to an object, where the property names are the same as the variables.
      // So we are going take the property names and place the variables in there.

      const first = 'snickers';
      const last = 'bos';
      const age = 2;
      const breed = 'King Charles Cav';
      // const dog = {
      //   first: first,
      //   last: last,
      //   age: age,
      //   breed: breed,
      // };
      // Now that is ok, but it is very repetitive as we are doing the samething
      // over and over again. We just made an object with all those variables
      // inside of it. If we add a console.log that you will see it is just a
      // regular object.
      // console.log(dog);
      // What we can do is if the property name and the variable you are setting
      // it to are named the exact same thing. You do not need to do this twice.
      // You can take out the variables:
      const dog = {
        first,
        last,
        age,
        breed,
      };
      console.log(dog);
      // This may look strange because this kind of looks like an array. But it
      // is an object. Doing that still gives the exact same object we are
      // looking for.
