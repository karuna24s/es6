      const course = 'RFB2';
      const flightNumber = '20-AC2018-jz';
      const accountNumber = '825242631RT0001';
      const make = 'BMW';
      const model = 'x5';
      const colour = 'Royal Blue';
      // Strings in ES6 come with four new methods that are really useful, help
      // us write more readable code, as well as reduce our reliance on using
      // RegExp for certain things. RFB stands for react for beginners.

      // .startsWith()

      // What I want to confirm is does the string start with it? We can just take the
      // course, if it starts with RFB. In the console you can type in
      // course.startsWith('RFB'); That is going to show me true because it does
      // start with it. If I did rfb ... lowercase, it says false. There is no
      // way to make this case insensitive. If you do need case sensitivity you
      // still need you use a RegExp.
      // One other thing that startsWith will do it will allow you to skip a
      // certain number of characters and start looking at it. Example with this
      // flightNumber here, I want to see if it starts with AC. Type the following
      // line in the console: flightNumber.startsWith('AC'); and it will return
      // false, because, it starts with 20-. Sometimes we have these SKU numbers,
      // when they start with a bunch of characters and then it gets to actually
      // what we want. So what you can do is run flightNumber.startsWith('AC', 3);
      // (which means start after 3 characters) in the console. And it will
      // return true because it ignores the first three and starts at AC and checks
      // against that.

      // course.startsWith('RFB');
      // flightNumber.startsWith('AC', 3);

      // .endsWith()

      // endsWith works fairly similar. Here is an example where have jz at the
      // the end of the flightNumber variable and I want to know to confirm in the
      // console flightNumber.endsWith('jz'); will return true or false. It will
      // return true because it ends with jz. There is another option that we can
      // pass endsWith, and I am going to use this accountNumber variable as an
      // example here. In Canada we have business numbers which are nine digits
      // long. Then you have a tax number which RT 0001, 0002. Of you need to know
      // if this number is a tax number or a corporate tax number or is this a
      // payroll number. So I need to check if this accountNumber endsWith RT and I
      // want to ignore this 001 number. What you can do is the tell the account
      // number to just take the first X number of characters and ignore the rest.
      // In the consoe, type in accountNumber.endsWith('RT'), it return false. But
      // if I can tell it to only take the first 11 numbers like so
      // accountNumber.endsWith('RT', 11) and it will return true. Essentially
      // you are going to take the first 11 numbers and ignore the rest and then
      // see if ends with RT.

      // flightNumber.endsWith('jz');
      // accountNumber.endsWith('RT', 11)

      // .includes()

      // includes() method will just check if that a character/element is
      // anywhere in a string. According to MDN, the includes() method determines
      // whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false.
      // Here is an an example where I want to check if my flightNumber includes
      // AC. In the console, I would type in flightNumber.includes('AC'), it will
      // return true. Again it is not case sensitive so you cannot do type in
      // flightNumber.includes('ac'). It used be called .contains but is now
      // called .includes because of some conflicts with the chrome and firefox
      // dev tools.

      // flightNumber.includes('AC');

      // .repeat()

      // .repeat() allows you to take the string and repeat it. For example: If
      // you type 'Karuna'.repeat(10); in the console, it will repeat Karuna ten
      // times. How is .repeat() useful? Sometimes we have some words here like
      // words here like I am going to take BMW X5 in royal blue (which are make,
      // model, and color variables) and if I wanted to display them maybe in a
      // terminal or something, but I want to right align them. How would that
      // work? I would have to just put a whole bunch of padding in, depending on
      // how long each string was and how much space will go in here. That is
      // what is called a leftPad function and you can use .repeat() to code a
      // nice little leftPad function. So create a leftPad function that will
      // take in the string that we want to pad and the length that we wish to
      // have it. I am going to set the length to a default of 20 characters.

      function leftPad(string, length = 20) {
        // we can return a string which we start with a little arrow, just
        // to show us where we are and we need to then need to pad it with
        // however many characters we need. We will take a space and repeat
        // however many we need which will be the string of the length minus
        // string.length. If string.length is 3, it is going to give us 17
        // spaces that have been repeated, and then we just tack on the string.
        return `â†’ ${' '.repeat(length - string.length)}${string}`;

      }

      // Next lets add a console.log to each of the three variables: make, model,
      // and colour. We are leaving out the length because we are going to
      // default it to 20, and it should just pass in the make, model, and color.
      // If you refresh your broser and look at the console each of the three
      // variables are perfecly aligned.

      console.log(leftPad(make));
      console.log(leftPad(model));
      console.log(leftPad(colour));

      // Another example that we can do is that we can take an ES6 template
      // string and inside of that let's add a statement in the console where we
      // take a string and multiply by it by like this:

      // `${'Karuna' * 5}`

      // It will return 'NAN'. 'NAN' is a value representing Not-A-Number.

      // What happens when we call repeat on that statement 10 times and tack on
      // :

      // `${'Karuna' * 5}`.repeat(10) + ' is awesome.'

      // It will return 'NANNANNANNANNANNANNANNANNANNAN is awesome.'

      // Because what is happening here is that you are giving yourself
      // essentially a string of Nan, and repeating it 10 times and tacking on
      // is awesome on to the end.
