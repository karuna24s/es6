      // Strings in ES6 come with four new methods that are really useful, help
      // us write more readable code, as well as reduce our reliance on using
      // RegExp for certain things. RFB stands for react for beginners. What I
      // want to confirm is does the string start with it? We can just take the
      // course, if it starts with RFB. In the console you can type in
      // course.startsWith('RFB'); That is going to show me true because it does
      // start with it. If I did rfb ... lowercase, it says false. There is no
      // way to make this case insensitive. If you do need case sensitivity you
      // still need you use a RegExp.
      // One other thing that startsWith will do it will allow you to skip a
      // certain number of characters and start looking at it. Example with this
      // flightNumber here, I want to see if it starts with AC. It's false,
      // because, it starts with 20=AC

      // .startsWith()

      // course.startsWith('RFB');
      // flightNumber.startsWith('AC');

      // .endsWith()

      // .includes()

      // .repeat()
