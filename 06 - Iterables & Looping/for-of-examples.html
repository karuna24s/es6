      // Let's take a deeper look at what an iterable actually is. Here I got
      // an array and I am looping over it and I add a console.log(cut).
      // What if I want to get the index of that individual cut. There is no
      // good way to do that here unless I were to say cuts that indexOf and
      // find it every single time. But what we don't know about yet there are
      // generators (it will be covered in es6 course). IF you go into your
      // console and type in cuts.entries(); What will that return? An array
      // iterator. If you open it up, you expect to get all the data, but there
      // is nothing in there. All you know that there is a next function that we
      // can call on it. 
      const cuts = ['Chuck', 'Brisket', 'Shank', 'Short Rib'];

      for (const cut of cuts) {
