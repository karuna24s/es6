      // Let's take a deeper look at what an iterable actually is. Here I got
      // an array and I am looping over it and I add a console.log(cut).
      // What if I want to get the index of that individual cut. There is no
      // good way to do that here unless I were to say cuts that indexOf and
      // find it every single time. But what we don't know about yet there are
      // generators (it will be covered in es6 course). If you go into your
      // console and type in cuts.entries(); What will that return? An array
      // iterator. If you open it up, you expect to get all the data, but there
      // is nothing in there. All you know that there is a next function that we
      // can call on it. So if we store that array cuts.entries in a variable,
      // so const meat = cuts.entries(); When we type in meat in the console, it
      // returns an Array iterator and we can iterate through each of the cuts.
      // Manually this loop below does it for us, but if we ever wanted to do it
      // manually in more examples when we hit generators. Let's call
      // meet.next(); in the console several times and let's see what happens..
      // The first time we called it we got done false and that means that the
      // loop hasn't finished -- more in the generator video. Then the value is
      // an array where the first thing is going to be the index and the second
      // thing is going to be the actual value. Then second one is brisket. So
      // the iterator tells what the index is and what cut is in the array. So
      // why would this be useful to us in this video where we are learning
      // about for...of? Because what you can do is if we iterate over not just
      // over the plain array but we iterate over the array iterator which is
      // .entries... watch what we will get now:
      const cuts = ['Chuck', 'Brisket', 'Shank', 'Short Rib'];

      // for (const cut of cuts) {
      //   console.log(cut);
      // }
      //
      // for (const cut of cuts.entries()) {
      //   console.log(cut);
      // }

      // Ok so in the console, we now get cut is an array every single time that
      // we go through it. In order to get each item by index, we can use
      // destructuring. For const [i, cut] i stands for index. Because each of
      // these are going to return an array. We can just immediately destructure
      // that into their own variables. Add a console.log(`${cut} is the ${i}`);
      // Now we should have a variable called cut and a variable called i. If
      // you run this code in the console, it returns the variable cut is the
      // variable i item. If you want to offset you add item i+1 instead of i.
      // So what are we doing here? We are using cuts.entries to bring us an
      // iterator.. for...of. For...of can pretty much handle anything that you
      // can throw at it. You don't have to think about what kind of data is this?
      // Which loop should I use? In almost all cases except for objects you
      // can just you your for...of, and just throw anything at it and the for..of
      // loop is going to just figure out how to handle that data for you. So
      // here I destructured the data as we actually go on in and we are off
      // and running with that.

      // for (const [i, cut] of cuts.entries()) {
      //   console.log(`${cut} is the ${i + 1} item`);
      // }

      // Let's look at another example for which for...of is useful. That is
      // when you are going to try to iterate over the arguments object.
      // Let's create a function called addUpNumbers

      // function addUpNumbers() {
      //   // This is a regular array. In the console you can see the prototype and
      //   // see all the methods associated with this an array like entries, every,
      //   // map, push, pop, and reduce.
      //   // console.log([1, 2, 3]);
      //   // Arguments is simply just a list with only one thing on it: length.
      //   // However you can iterate over it with the for..of loop because it has
      //   // a symbol iterator. Normally we can convert the argauments to a real
      //   // array, and use a reduce on it and add them all up.
      //   // console.log(arguments);
      //   // For whatever reason, if you are in the use case where can you cannot
      //   // convert your arguments to an object maybe for some performance reasons,
      //   // or whatever you have, then you can go ahead and loop over arguments
      //   // without first converting to an array. There is no need to convert it
      //   // to an array if you just need to loop over them. What I am going to do
      //   // is I am going to say:
      //   // set up a variable:
      //   let total = 0;
      //   // loop over each of them.
      //   for (const num of arguments) {
      //     total += num;
      //   }
      //   // add in a console.log so we can see what the total returns
      //   // so in the console it return 267..it returns the variable and it
      //   // loops through it and updated every single one of them. If I want to
      //   // call addUpNumbers, what is addUpNUmbers(10,10) => returns 20.
      //   console.log(total);
      //   return total;
      // }
      // // for...in justs us the index and for...of gives us the argument
      // // That function is called like this:
      // addUpNumbers(10, 23, 52, 34, 12, 13, 123);

      // You have no idea how many numbers are going to be passed. In other
      // words you cannot add so many placeorders like num1, num2, num3, just
      // in case they past many because you have absolutely no idea how many
      // arguments are going to pass. So instead of putting anything in there.
      // What we can do inside of this function is to just console.log this
      // variable called arguments. Now arguments is a special word and it is
      // going to be an array-ish type where it will give us all of the actual
      // arguments. So as you can see in the console that arguments is now what
      // looks to be an array, it is not exactly an array of everything that got
      // passed in. The reason why this is arrayish is because..first of all the
      // prototype is not an array.
      // So here is one example of what you could loop over it. You don't need
      // to convert to a true array, you can just use the for...of to iterate
      // over it.

      // What else can we use the for...of to iterate over?
      // How about a string?

      // const name = 'Karuna Sehgal';
      // for (const char of name) {
      //   console.log(char);
      // }

      // This returns each character of the string.
      // Make sure you put a let, const, or var in front of num or char
      // otherwise you are going to be overwriting the actual variable
      // every single time instead of creating a let or a const that is scoped
      // to that actual block. Finally you can also loop over the DOM
      // collections without having to convert to a true array. Now DOM
      // collections are Nodelist or HTML collections. They are being changed
      // so that you have all of your .forEach, .map and all of those array
      // methods that you are used to. However in most browsers they are not a
      // true array so we could use the for...of.

      // Let's add some paragraph tags in the body tag. Then we want to select
      // them and then add a console.log and go to the broswer. We see a
      // nodelist but if you open up the nodelist you will see that we have
      // a forEach method and a couple of other array methods that we are used
      // to. If you want to loop over it with a for...of loop. Add the following
      // code and you will see that we get each individual paragraph in the
      // console. That is useful if you want to do something like add an
      // eventlistener. So anytime somebody clicks on a paragraph go ahead and
      // console.log(this.textContent); of it. You don't need to convert it to
      // an array. It is helpful to know that you can for...of with things that
      // are not arrays as long as they are an iterable. And what is an
      // iterable? ... a DOM collection, argument, string, an array, map or set.

      const ps = document.querySelectorAll('p');
      // console.log(ps);
      for (const paragraph of ps) {
        // console.log(paragraph);
        paragraph.addEventListener('click', function () {
          console.log(this.textContent);
        })
      }
