      // We have a new type of loop in JavaScript, and that is the for of loop.
      // It is used to loop over any type of datat that isn't iterable. We are
      // going to learn all about different types of iterables and we are going
      // to learn why this for of loop is so useful when we hit things like
      // generators and maps and sets. For now we want to get an idea as to
      // how this loop actually works. What is an iterable? An iterable is
      // anything that can be looped over. If you have an array, you can loop
      // over an array, or a string, or a map or a set, or a generator. We are
      // going to look at all kinds of different examples as to when you can do
      // it, but let'ts get going with looking at some of the existing loops
      // first, and see what are the shortcomings of our existing loops, and
      // why does for of sort of shine above all of them in a couple of these
      // use cases.
