      // We have a new type of loop in JavaScript, and that is the for of loop.
      // It is used to loop over any type of data that isn't iterable. We are
      // going to learn all about different types of iterables and we are going
      // to learn why this for of loop is so useful when we hit things like
      // generators and maps and sets. For now we want to get an idea as to
      // how this loop actually works. What is an iterable? An iterable is
      // anything that can be looped over. If you have an array, you can loop
      // over an array, or a string, or a map or a set, or a generator. We are
      // going to look at all kinds of different examples as to when you can do
      // it, but let's get going with looking at some of the existing loops
      // first, and see what are the shortcomings of our existing loops, and
      // why does for of sort of shine above all of them in a couple of these
      // use cases.

      // First use case:
      // We have an array with 4 items in it. We are going to look at the
      // regular for loop.
      const cuts = ['Chuck', 'Brisket', 'Shank', 'Short Rib'];

      cuts.shop = 'MM MEats';

      // for (let i = 0; i < cuts.length; i++) {
      //   console.log(cuts[i]);
      // }

      // In the console you will see each item that is in the array.
      // What is the downside?
      // The console.log(cuts[i]); is confusing syntax.

      // What is other kind of loops do we have?
      // We have the .forEach array method, if we says cuts.forEach that
      // will give us a function, we can use an arrow function. forEach will
      // us a function called cut and we console.log(cut)
      // cuts.forEach((cut) => {
      //   console.log(cut);
      // });
      // This works pretty well. What is the downside to that? Well, we
      // cannot abort this loop. We cannot skip one of the items in the array.
      // For example, if I wanted to stop once we hit the word brisket, I would
      // say if cut = bristket then I would break and then that it console.log
      // first two items only (chuck and brisket) and then it would stop the
      // loop. In the console, we get an Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break
      // statement error. It couldn't work because you cannot use a break inside
      // of a forEach loop. Same goes for continue. We cannot continue or skip.
      // cuts.forEach((cut) => {
      //   console.log(cut);
      //   // if(cut === 'Brisket') {
      //   //   break;
      //   // }
      // });
      // I like to use forEach in a couple of use cases, but if you need to be
      // able to skip over then thats a good one.

      // We also have the for...in loop. In the console, this loop with give us
      // the index. With the shuffle prototype method, this loop iterates over
      // everything in the array, including things that have been added to the
      // prototype. It iterates over the items of the collection and over
      // additional things that have been added. Now anytime you added a
      // property or anything to the array, it will also show up in this loop.

      // for (const index in cuts) {
      //   console.log(cuts[index]);
      // }

      // Next we have the for...of loop, which gives us the best of all three
      // worlds. You are able to use the for...of loop for any type of data,
      // except objects. Despite adding a prototype type to the array (shuffle),
      // we still only get actual items of the cuts array with the for...of
      // loop. You are able to use break and continue as well.

      for (const cut of cuts) {
        if(cut === 'Brisket') {
          // skips over Brisket successfully
          continue;
        }
        console.log(cut);
      }
