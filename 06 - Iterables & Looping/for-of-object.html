      // Now there is one thing that we have not been able to iterate
      // over and that is an object. An object is not an iterable. So we
      // are attempting to use const prop of apple and console.log the
      // property. When we try that, we get an type error that apple is not an
      // iterable.
      // So what are some of our options? There is an object method called
      // entries. Just like we used .entries against our array, we are going
      // to be able to do .entries against an object. Now we don't have .entries
      // yet. Object.values and Object.entries will be included in ES2017. If you
      // would like to use .entries..here is a simple solution, you can go to
      // You can use Object.keys(apple) which will return an array of all the
      // keys. So we don't have values left and we don't have entries yet.

      const apple = {
        color: 'Red',
        size: 'Medium',
        weight: 50,
        sugar: 10
      };
      // returns all the keys
      for (const prop of Object.keys(apple)) {
        console.log(prop);
      }

      // if you want to find the values
      // for (const prop of Object.keys(apple)) {
      //   const value = apple[prop];
      //   console.log(value, prop);
      // }

      // or
      for (const prop in apple) {
        const value = apple[prop];
        console.log(value, prop);
      }
      // Until we have objects and entries, let's stick to just using a for...in
      // loop for objects.
