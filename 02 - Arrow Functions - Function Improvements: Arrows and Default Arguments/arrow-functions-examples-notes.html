      // Some Examples of Arrow functions:
      const race = '100m Dash';
      const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];
      // // object:
      // {
      //   name: 'Wes Bos',
      //   place: 1,
      //   race: race
      // }
      // use map to return an object from each of the winners:
      // console.table(win) prints out a table of win
      // instead of using race: race (this can be repetitive you can just use race
      // this is an es6 feature)
      // this is an example of doing an implicit return with an object literal:
      const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

      const ages = [23, 62, 45, 234, 2, 62, 234, 62, 34];
      // we want to filter this list for people who are older than 60 years old.

      const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
      console.log(old);
