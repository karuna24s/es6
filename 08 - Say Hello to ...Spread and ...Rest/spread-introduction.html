      // Let's talk about the spread operator. Those are the three apathetic
      // dots that you often see in front an array or any iterable. The spread
      // operator takes every single item from an iterable. An iterable is
      // anything that you can loop over with our for of loop and that incluedes
      // arrays, includes strings, includes DOM nodes, includes arguments object
      // and includes our maps and sets. We will use strings and arrays because
      // that is the simplest. That is probably most of the use cases where you
      // would actually use this. It is going take every single item from an
      // iterable, from an array, and apply it to the containing element or the
      // containing array.

      // We want to make a third array called pizzas where we combine the
      // featured and specialty arrays together.

      const featured = ['Deep Dish', 'Pepperoni', 'Hawaiian'];
      const specialty = ['Meatzza', 'Spicy Mama', 'Margherita'];

      const deepDish = {
        pizzaName: 'Deep Dish',
        size: 'Medium',
        ingredients: ['Marinara', 'Italian Sausage', 'Dough', 'Cheese']
      };
