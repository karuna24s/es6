    <title>The ...Spread Operator</title>

      // Let's talk about the spread operator. Those are the three apathetic
      // dots that you often see in front an array or any iterable. The spread
      // operator takes every single item from an iterable. An iterable is
      // anything that you can loop over with our for of loop and that incluedes
      // arrays, includes strings, includes DOM nodes, includes arguments object
      // and includes our maps and sets. We will use strings and arrays because
      // that is the simplest. That is probably most of the use cases where you
      // would actually use this. It is going take every single item from an
      // iterable, from an array, and apply it to the containing element or the
      // containing array.

      // We want to make a third array called pizzas where we combine the
      // featured and specialty arrays together.
      // How do you combine two arrays? You just take one and and call concat
      // against it and you pass it the second one.
      // const pizzas = featured.concat(specialty);
      // That will work. Add a console.log and checkout what happens in the console.
      // console.log(pizzas);
      // What if you wanted to put vegetable pizza right in the middle of that?
      // How would you do that? You would have to make a blank array. Then
      // let pizzas = [];
      // You would have add in the next line:
      // pizzas = pizzas.concat(featured);
      // pizzas.push('veg');
      // pizzas = pizzas.concat(specialty);
      // And over write the entire thing. This just becomes a big headache for
      // having to manage that. What you can do is, you can take every single
      // item in the array and spread into a new array.

      // If I have the string of 'karuna', what is every item in a string? Every
      // item in a string is just each character. What you can do is you pop an
      // array around it and that just gives you an array of one thing.
      // ['karuna'] => ["karuna"]

      // What if I wanted every single item of that iterable to be its own item
      // of the array? Inside of that dot, dot dot, that is going to spread each
      // item into the actual array.
      // [...'karuna'] => ["k", "a", "r", "u", "n", "a"]

      // Similarly, what we can do is take these existing arrays and spread the
      // items like featured, and spread the items of specialty into the new
      // pizzas array.
      // const pizzas = [...featured, ...specialty];
      // And now we should be able to have the pizzas array which has absolutely
      // every single element in here.

      // Similarly I can just also add veg in the middle of it:
      // const pizzas = [...featured, , 'veg', ...specialty];

      // I am just saying add every single item from here, and we should be
      // good. Let's take a look at what pizzas is now. Type in pizzas in
      // the console. And we see veg being added in the middle of the array.
      // What nice about that is that if you even want to copy an array, how
      // can we do that.

      // Let's say we want to take a copy of the pizzas array.
      // const fridayPizzas = [...pizzas];

      // If you add:
      // const fridayPizzas = pizzas;
      // You are just referencing the pizzas array to the fridayPizzas and not
      // make a copy of it.

      // A spread will take ever single item from an iterable and apply it into
      // the new array. 

      const featured = ['Deep Dish', 'Pepperoni', 'Hawaiian'];
      const specialty = ['Meatzza', 'Spicy Mama', 'Margherita'];
      const pizzas = [...featured, 'veg', ...specialty];
      const fridayPizzas = [...pizzas];

      const deepDish = {
        pizzaName: 'Deep Dish',
        size: 'Medium',
        ingredients: ['Marinara', 'Italian Sausage', 'Dough', 'Cheese']
      };
