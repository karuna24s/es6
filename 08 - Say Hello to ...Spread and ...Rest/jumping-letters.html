      // Let's do a little bit of an exercise with spread.
      // We will try spreading a string.
      // What I want you to do is this: when you over one of these letters, they
      // animate themselves on in. We are given an h2 tag with a class of jump
      // and it has spreads. You know that you can not hover on an individual
      // letter inside of an h2. In the elements panel (within inspect element)
      // look at the h2 inside of jump. Inside of that each one is wrapped in a
      // span. We need to use map, a spread operator and query selector all to
      // select the element.

      // Grab the h2 tag
      // We have the actual heading element and we need to take the text out of
      // the spread, wrap every single item in a span and inject it right back in.
      const heading = document.querySelector('.jump');
      // run sparanWrap function
      // Remember we want every single word to be an individual item.
      // const spans = sparanWrap(heading.textContent);

      // Now we are able to see each single character and spreads is now in its
      // own array because we took every single item out of the word and spread
      // it. However that is not good enough because we don't want to return
      // just an array. But we need to have every single item wrapped. That is
      // a use case for .map where we will take in a letter and return a template
      // string where it is a span and inside of that we have the letter. We
      // loop over every single letter and return that letter but wrapped in a
      // span. Being that we don't want an array but a string add a .join('')
      // Now that we have our HTML. We should now be able to the following:
      heading.innerHTML = sparanWrap(heading.textContent);

      // console.log(spans);
      // Create a function called sparanWrap, which is wrapping every single
      // item in spans. That is a function that takes in a word and it is going
      // return a bunch of HTML.
      function sparanWrap(word) {
        // Add a console.log(word) and see what data we can retrieve
        // console.log(word);
        // What we can do is spread that word
        // return [...word];
        return [...word].map(letter => `<span>${letter}</span>`).join('');
      }
