      // A really great use case for spread operators is when you spread into a
      // function. Let's look at this example we have an inventors array right
      // here and we want to take items from the newInventors array and put them
      // into inventors. We don't want a third array. We don't want to overwrite
      // the entire array. I just want to add them on the end. You might think
      // we take inventors and call the push method on it and we pass it the
      // new inventors. Let's see what that gives us:
      // inventors.push(newInventors);
      // console.log(inventors);
      // Now we get the three items and a fourth item which is the second array
      // of two things and inside it is the new inventors. But that is not what
      // we want. We just took the array and added it as a fourth item, so we
      // have an array in an array. We don't want that. A way that we could
      // have solved this in the past is:
      // inventors.push.apply(inventors, newInventors); and that work. What is
      // happening here is when you call apply, it's going to run the function
      // that you called apply against. But as every single item of the array as
      // an argument. It is essentially doing this:
      // inventors.push('Musk', 'Jobs'); because you can't pass push an array.
      // You can pass push as many arguments as you wish. So that is a lit bit
      // funky. Rather than that, what we could do is we simply call push and only
      // pass it the newInventors.
      // inventors.push(newInventors);
      // console.log(inventors);
      // Let's the issue we get with that. That's the array, but if you were to spread
      // into it, what does spread do? Spread is going to take Musk and Jobs and pass
      // it as individual arguments into push. Now we don't need have to worry about
      // any of that apply method.
      // inventors.push(...newInventors);
      // console.log(inventors);
      // We just spread right into the functions. We have been spreading into arrays.
      // But you can also spread into a function, where every single item of the
      // array is going to be used as an argument.

      const inventors = ['Einstein', 'Newton', 'Galileo'];
      const newInventors = ['Musk', 'Jobs'];
      inventors.push(...newInventors);
      console.log(inventors);

      // Let's build another example ourselves where we have a function that saysHi
      // It is going to have a first name and last name and we are simply just going
      // to alert (`Hey there ${first} ${last}`); And then I have someone's name
      // so const name = ['Karuna', 'Sehgal']; When we call the function we can
      // spread the array and that will pass 'Karuna' as the first argument and
      // 'Sehgal' as the second argument and the alert message appears correctly
      // with the updated arguments.

      const name = ['Karuna', 'Sehgal'];

      function sayHi(first, last) {
        alert(`Hey there ${first} ${last}`);
      }

      sayHi(...name);
