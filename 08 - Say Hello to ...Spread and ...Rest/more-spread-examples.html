      // Let's take a look at some more spread examples. One use case for a
      // spread is an alternative to Array.from(). Let's say we want to select
      // all of these people in the people div class.
      // Let's say const people = document.querySelectorAll('.people p'). And
      // add a console.log to people to see what is going on in the console.
      // So we got all the people on the list, but it is not an array. Instead it
      // is a nodelist. If I want to map against people we do something like:
      // const name = people.map(); You know that we are not able to do that
      // because people.map() is not a function. People is a nodelist and the
      // prototype doesn't have .map or .reduce or any of the our arrays. So you
      // could do this instead:
      // const people = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.people p'));
      // and that would give us a true array instead of a nodelist where our
      // map function is available.
      // There is another way we could convert a nodelist to an array is using
      // a spread operator and take every single item that it selects and spread
      // it right onto an array. So that is going to take everything that it
      // selects because a nodelist is an iterable and every single item from
      // that iterable can then be spread onto a new array:
      // const people = [...document.querySelectorAll('.people p')];
      // If you are on a team Array.from reads a little bit nicer compared to
      // using a spread operator.

      const people = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.people p'));
      const names = people.map((person) => person.textContent );
      // console.log(people);
      // Now we have names array of every single name

      const deepDish = {
        pizzaName: 'Deep Dish',
        size: 'Medium',
        ingredients: ['Marinara', 'Italian Sausage', 'Dough', 'Cheese']
      };

      // Here is another of example of when you want to create a new array off
      // of a property on an object.
