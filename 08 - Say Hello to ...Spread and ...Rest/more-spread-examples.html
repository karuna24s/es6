      // Let's take a look at some more spread examples. One use case for a
      // spread is an alternative to Array.from(). Let's say we want to select
      // all of these people in the people div class.
      // Let's say const people = document.querySelectorAll('.people p'). And
      // add a console.log to people to see what is going on in the console.
      // So we got all the people on the list, but it is not an array. Instead it
      // is a nodelist. If I want to map against people we do something like:
      // const name = people.map(); You know that we are not able to do that
      // because people.map() is not a function. People is a nodelist and the
      // prototype doesn't have .map or .reduce or any of the our arrays. So you
      // could do this instead:
      // const people = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.people p'));
      // and that would give us a true array instead of a nodelist where our
      // map function is available.
      // There is another way we could convert a nodelist to an array is using
      // a spread operator and take every single item that it selects and spread
      // it right onto an array. So that is going to take everything that it
      // selects because a nodelist is an iterable and every single item from
      // that iterable can then be spread onto a new array:
      // const people = [...document.querySelectorAll('.people p')];
      // If you are on a team Array.from reads a little bit nicer compared to
      // using a spread operator.

      const people = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.people p'));
      const names = people.map((person) => person.textContent );
      console.log(people);
      console.log(names);
      // Now we have names array of every single name

      const deepDish = {
        pizzaName: 'Deep Dish',
        size: 'Medium',
        ingredients: ['Marinara', 'Italian Sausage', 'Dough', 'Cheese']
      };

      // Here is another of example of when you want to create a new array off
      // of a property on an object. This is similar to where we merged two
      // arrays togerther. Maybe we did:
      // const shoppingList = []; We know we have to buy milk and flour to make
      // the pizza and being that tonight is deepDish pizza night we have to get
      // all the ingredients from it. What we can do is just immediately spread
      // all of the ingredients from deepDish.ingredients. Since that is an
      // array it is going to take every single item from that and put it into
      // the new shoppingList. If I add a console.log(shoppingList), we know
      // have every single item in it.
      const shoppingList = ['Milk', 'Flour', ...deepDish.ingredients];
      console.log(shoppingList);

      // This is an example where we have an array of objects and we need to
      // remove one of those objects from the array (occurs quite often in
      // React and Redux) and all you are given is this id variable with that id
      // inside of it. How do you actually take it away?
      // First we need to figure out where in the array is this comment. As the
      // ID does not tell us anything about its location inside the array.
      // How would we do that?
      // We would use the .findIndex() method of the array:
      // const commentIndex = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === id);
      // When the comment.id === id variable then return and that will tell us
      // where the index is. So we had in a console.log(commentIndex) which tells
      // us that the index is 2. That is the one we want.
      // Now how do we actually delete it from the array.
      // Previously what we had to do is slice everything before, slice
      // everything after. What we can do here is we will make a new comment
      // variable. We will say:
      // const newComments = [];
      // Now we want everything up until the mean comment and everything after
      // the mean comment. What we can do is slice from the start to where we
      // want, and then slice from one after the one that we want to the end.
      // So we will say:
      // const newComments = [comments.slice(0,commentIndex), comments.slice(commentIndex + 1)];
      // Let's add a console.log(newComments); And we get an array of arrays, which
      // is the first part and the second part. That is not very useful because you
      // don't want an array of arrays. You want an array of comments objects.
      // So what we can do is just spread these two and spread the second part as
      // well and that will take every item out of the array and put it into this
      // new comment array.
      // const newComments = [...comments.slice(0,commentIndex), ...comments.slice(commentIndex + 1)];
      // now we have the newComments array and successfully removed the mean comment
      // from the array.

      const comments = [
        { id: 209384, text: 'I love your dog!' },
        { id: 523423, text: 'Cuuute! 🐐' },
        { id: 632429, text: 'You are so dumb' },
        { id: 192834, text: 'Nice work on this wes!' },
      ];

      const id = 632429;
      const commentIndex = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === id);
      console.log(commentIndex);

      const newComments = [...comments.slice(0,commentIndex), ...comments.slice(commentIndex + 1)];
      console.log(newComments);
