      // Arrow functions have three main benefits:
      //  - More concise than regular functions.
      //  - They have implicit returns, which allow as to write minimal code.
      //  - Doesn't rebind the value of this when you use an arrow function inside another function,
      //    which comes in handy for click event handlers.

      // Names array and we want to add bos to the end of each of these names:
      const names = ['wes', 'kait', 'lux'];
      // Normally, we would do something like this:
      const fullNames = names.map(function(name) {
        return `${name} bos`;
      });
      // console.log(fullNames);
      // How to convert it to an arrow function?
      const fullNames2 = names.map((name) => {
        return `${name} bos`;
      });
      // console.log(fullNames2);
      // Another way we can convert it to an arrow function especially if you
      // have one parameter:
      const fullNames3 = names.map(name => {
        return `${name} bos`;
      });
      // console.log(fullNames3);
      // What else can we do with this? We can do an implicit return. Explicit return means
      // when you explicitly write the word return (actually right the word return) for what
      // you are returning but lot of these callback functions we write in javaScript are just
      // one liners where we just return something like so:
      const fullNames4 = names.map(name => `${name} bos`);
      // When you delete the curly brackets it will be an implicit return in which we don't need
      // to specify that we are returning name bos it will just assume that we are doing so.
      // console.log(fullNames4);
      // If you don't have any arguments in this case you need pass an empty parantheses:
      const fullNames5 = names.map(() => `cool bos`);
      // console.log(fullNames5);
      // Another thing we need to know about arrow functions is that arrow functions are
      // always anonymous functions, which means

      // named function:
      // function sayMyName(name) {
      //   alert(`Hello ${name}`);
      // }
      // Benefits of having a named function is that if you have a stacked trace which means if
      // you have an error and you want to figure where did this go wrong it will mention the name
      // of the function in the console. So if you want to use an arrow function, you cannot name
      // them. You can put them in a variable like:
      const sayMyName = (name) => { alert(`Hello ${name}!`) }

      sayMyName('Karuna');
      // So that is a function declaration there. The thing we need to know is that it is an
      // anonymous function and it will not give us very good stacked traces.
