    // There is a couple of other things we can do with destructuring and they
    // are all related to functions. So this function is a convertCurrency
    // function that takes an amount like 100 bucks and it is going to return
    // an object that has US, pounds, Australian dollars and Mexican Bucks,
    // pesos. We run it here with $100 Canadian and it is going to return to me
    // this object here. When I console.log this object, we see that we have all
    // values here.
    // Previously, if I wanted to get the Australian dollars I would say
    // hundo.AUD and I would say hundo.Mex to get the Mexican pesos. However,
    // with destructuring, you can sort of return multiple values from a
    // function. What I mean by is that you can't really return multiple values,
    // but you can return an object and destructure the answer from that. 
      function convertCurrency(amount) {
        const converted = {
          USD: amount * 0.76,
          GPB: amount * 0.53,
          AUD: amount * 1.01,
          MEX: amount * 13.30
        };
        return converted;
      }

      const hundo = convertCurrency(100);
      console.log(hundo);
