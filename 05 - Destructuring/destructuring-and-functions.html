    // There is a couple of other things we can do with destructuring and they
    // are all related to functions. So this function is a convertCurrency
    // function that takes an amount like 100 bucks and it is going to return
    // an object that has USD, pounds, Australian dollars and Mexican Bucks,
    // pesos. We run it here with $100 Canadian and it is going to return to us
    // this object here. When we can console.log this object, we see that we have
    // all the values here.
    // Previously, if we wanted to get the Australian dollars we would say
    // hundo.AUD and we would say hundo.Mex to get the Mexican pesos. However,
    // with destructuring, you can sort of return multiple values from a
    // function. What we mean by that is you can't really return multiple values,
    // but you can return an object and destructure the answer from that.
    // Rather than just console.log(hundo); We are going to destructure the object
    // immediately as it comes back, and say USD, GPD, AUD, and MEX. Now we
    // should be able to take these values and console.log them individually,
    // and you know that we get them. If we type one in the console, we see
    // it individually, so it did not need that variable with all the properties
    // on it. We can destructure them all into four separate values as we want.
    // Another cool thing about it is that you do not need to care about the
    // order in which they come out, like flipping GPB property with USD
    // because it is just an object. So we could put this in
    // any order that we want and it would still just work fine.
    // Especially what is cool is that if you only need AUD and USD, you don't
    // need to destructure the rest of them and they will never show their face.
    // They are simply just going be returned for this function and
    // destructured immediately. The other two will just be thrown out. We can
    // console.log(USD, AUD). So that is two things there, where you can return
    // multiple values as well as pick and choose the pieces that you want
    // to return from a function.

      function convertCurrency(amount) {
        const converted = {
          USD: amount * 0.76,
          GPB: amount * 0.53,
          AUD: amount * 1.01,
          MEX: amount * 13.30
        };
        return converted;
      }

      // const hundo = convertCurrency(100);
      // // console.log(hundo);
      // console.log(hundo.AUD);
      // console.log(hundo.MEX);

      // const { USD, GPB, AUD, MEX } = convertCurrency(100);
      // console.log(USD, GPB, AUD, MEX);

      const { USD, AUD } = convertCurrency(100);
      console.log(USD, AUD);

      // Other type of concept we want to cover is default named arguments. We
      // already went though that last example, where we had a function called
      // tipCalc. We had the total, and we had the tip. We set the tip to
      // default 15 percent and then we had the tax which we set to default 0.13.
      // That works well, because we know that the first thing is going to be
      // total, second thing is going to be tip, third thing will be tax.
      // There is some things we can do to make order independent. The first
      // thing we are going to do is just finish off this function here and
      // return to total, the tip times the total and the tax times the total.
      // Then we are going to wrap these three arguments in curly brackets.
      // What that is going to do is that, when we pass in an object, it is
      // going to destructure them into three variables total, tip, and tax.
      // So it is not like we are going to have to say options.total,
      // options.tip. It is going to destructure into three variables
      // available inside of this actual function. Then when we call it, we
      // simply run tipCalc and we pass it an object with the total value.
      // Maybe that is going to be $200. We pass the tip at 0.20 and we pass
      // the tax at 0.13. We are going to put that in a variable and refresh.
      // In the console, we get $266. That is the total. But what is really
      // important here, first of all. We can leave off things we don't need.
      // like tax and in the console we still get 266. As well we can put them
      // in any order that we please.

      // function tipCalc({ total, tip = 0.15, tax = 0.13 }) {
      //   return total + (tip * total) + (tax * total);
      // }

      // const bill = tipCalc({ total: 200, tip: 0.20, tax: 0.13 });
      // console.log(bill);

      // const bill = tipCalc({ total: 200, tip: 0.20,});
      // console.log(bill);

      // So we are passing in an object here and it is getting destructured.
      // const bill = tipCalc({ tip: 0.20, total: 200 });
      // console.log(bill);

      // One last thing is, if you want to pass in nothing, let's say if we put
      // a default for the the total to be $100. And we just want to run
      // tipCalc(); What happened in the console? We get an error because it
      // cannot match against undefined or null. It is a destructuring error
      // and that is because we have passed in none of these things. We passed
      // in no object for it to destructure against, so you have to give it
      // itself a default argument so that if the entire argument which is one
      // object, if no object is passed it is going to default to just a blank
      // object and all of the three are going to to be in. This is a little
      // bit of a funky syntax, so it takes some time to get comfortable with
      // it. It is definitely worth getting used to because it is going to
      // really help you reduce a lot of your boilerplate code where you are
      // checking for defaults.

      function tipCalc({ total = 100, tip = 0.15, tax = 0.13 } = {}) {
        return total + (tip * total) + (tax * total);
      }

      const bill = tipCalc();
      console.log(bill);
