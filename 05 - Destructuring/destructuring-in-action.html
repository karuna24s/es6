      // Let's take a look at an example where I can swap variables with
      // destructuring. In this example we am building an application for a
      // wrestling application. First I want to create a variable where there is
      // one wrestler in the ring and one that is a backup wrestler.
      let inRing = 'Hulk Hogan';
      let onSide = 'The Rock';

      // So they need to tag them each other. So what happens when you need to
      // switch? The Rock is going in the ring and Hulk Hogan is going on the
      // side. In the console, if you type inRing, it returns 'Hulk Hogan'. In
      // the console, if you type in inRing = 'The Rock'. Now if you type in
      // inRing inside the console, it will return 'The Rock' and if you type in
      // onSide, it will also return 'The Rock'.

      // In the past, I can make a temp variable to switch the other
      // variables:
      // var temp = inRing;
      // inRing = onSide;
      // onSide = temp;
      // Now that they are totally switched, you could delete you temp variable.
      // That's really hard to follow. That is hard to look at especially for
      // someone who is not familiar with your code.

      // With destructuring, I just swap them. I take an array (with both the
      // variables, which we want to switch) and make them equal to another
      // array (with both variables that are switched)

      // So what will do? It is going to create an array of onSide, inRing
      // and immediately destructure them into the opposite variables. Now you
      // see why I  used let instead of const here, because I am actually
      // updating the values of these variables. Let's take these inRing and
      // onSide variables and console.log them beforehand and console.log them
      // after I destructure them into the opposite variables.
      console.log(inRing, onSide);
      [inRing, onSide] = [onSide, inRing];
      console.log(inRing, onSide);
      // Now in the console you see Hulk Hogan The Rock and then The Rock Hulk
      // Hogan. They have swapped themselves, without the need for a third swap
      // temp variable.
