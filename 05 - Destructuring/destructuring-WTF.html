      // So I just learned about destructuring. But can I put all together into
      // one major thing (object) ?

      // Object Destructuring with variable renaming & default values
      const { w: width = 400, h: height = 500 } = { w: 800 }

      // So what is going on here and what are the variables that are being
      // created? Let's check in the console. What are the variables that are
      // being created? The variables that are being created are width and height.
      // Why?? Because it is destructuring w and h. But it is renaming them to
      // width and height. When I type in width, it returns and when I type in
      // height it returns 500. So what is happening here is that it is
      // destructuring width from the object on the right. It is going to take
      // 800. Then it immediately renames itself to width. So it is going to be 800.
      // Then height, what are these equals next to height and width, those are
      // default values. Height, there is no h being passed at all, so h tries
      // to destructure from the object in the right. It can't, so it falls back
      // to 500 default and then renamed itself to height.
