    // Inside the scope where the const and let variables are declared
    // we can only do that once.
      const key = 'abc123';
      let points = 50;
      // scope to the window
      let winner = false;

    // Example:
    // let points = 60;
    // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'points' has already been declared
    // As you don't want to declare the same variable twice instead you can
    // update a let variable like: points = 60;

    // if(points > 40) {
      // this is scoped to this block. But it has been declared before in the window.
      // let winner = true;
    // }
    // If you type winner in the console, you will get false because

    // The difference between const and let is that const variables cannot be updated
    // and let variables are made to be updated.

    // Sometimes people assume that const is immuatable example being:
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: '28'
    }
    // So you have to this person variable but if I try to update that to something
    // like person = { name: 'Karuna'} in the console:
    // I will see Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    // However the properties of const can change like:
    // person.name = 'Karuna';

    // If you want to freeze everything you can use Object.freeze(),it now part of ES6
    const wes = Object.freeze(person);
    // now you will have a wes variable and you can try to update the properties using
    // wes.age = 30; now if you type wes.age it will return 28 because you can not change
    // anything on the wes variable.
