      // using var declare pizza to equal deep dish and add a console.log(pizza); Everything works!
      // var pizza = 'Deep Dish 🍕🍕🍕';
      // console.log(pizza);
      // Well what happens if you add console.log(pizza); before we use var to declare pizza to
      // equal deep dish:
      // console.log(pizza);
      // var pizza = 'Deep Dish 🍕🍕🍕';
      // console.log(pizza); will return undefined because with var variables you can access them
      // as they are defined, before they are defined, you cannot access the actual value of them
      // (deep dish) but you can access the fact that the variable has been created before.

      // Now if I change that to const or let you will now see an Uncaught
      // ReferenceError: pizza is not defined in the console because so that is an actual
      // error and break your code.
      console.log(pizza);
      const pizza = 'Deep Dish 🍕🍕🍕';
      // temporal dead zone is where you cannot access the variable before it is defined.

      // Use const by default (if you want keep it the same value). Only use let if
      // rebinding is needed (if you need to update the value of your variable).
      // var shouldn't be used in ES6.
