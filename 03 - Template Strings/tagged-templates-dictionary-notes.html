      // An example of when tagged templates can come in handy. It is when you
      // want to add an abbreviation tag to a sentence.

      // Dictionary object:
      const dict = {
        HTML: 'Hyper Text Markup Language',
        CSS: 'Cascading Style Sheets',
        JS: 'JavaScript'
      };
      // create addAbbreviations function here, where I will create a new array
      // of values that if there is an abbreviation, I want wrapped in an
      // abbreviated tag.
      function addAbbreviations(strings, ...values) {
        // create a variable called abbreviated and I am going to take regular
        // values and map over them and return a new array of values.
        // for each value..now we are going to check if there is a value in the
        // dictionary.
        const abbreviated = values.map(value => {
          // if the dictionary has an item for that specific value,then we will
          // return the `abbr` tag and the title of the `abbr` tag is going to
          // be the dictionary item with that key of "HTML, CSS, JS, or Ruby".
          // Then inside of the abbreviation tag we are going to return the value
          // there. So what that is going to give us if we console.log the abbreviated
          // tag.
          if(dict[value]) {
            return `<abbr title="${dict[value]}">${value}</abbr>`
          }
          // otherwise we want to return the value.
          return value;
        });
        // console.log(abbreviated);
        // remember to add the addAbbreviations function before My name in the
        // sentence variable.
        // So now each of our values array is now abbr tags that have been
        // created for us. Now that we are working with this abbr tag. We can
        // take our strings array and start to piece it together.
        // We are going to return strings.reduce(). The way that reduce works
        // is that it will loop over each one and build the string as we go.
        // Reduce takes two things, takes this function and it takes what you
        // start with. We are going to start with an empty string, and then the
        // actual function that we want to run is going to be an anonymous function,
        // which gives us sentence, which is going to be whatever the previous
        // one was. It is going to give us an actual string and the index for that
        // one. I am going to use an arrow function with a block here. From that
        // we return. We are going to build this together. We are going to take
        // the existing sentence. This will be whatever was from the last iteration.
        // We are going to tack on the string. Do not need a space between sentence
        // and string because the spaces that are in the string will come along
        // in the string itself. Then we want to tack on the abbreviated, because
        // we have this array here. Square bracket i or nothing. What that does
        // when you check the html page in the browser, and you hover over the HTML,
        // CSS, JS works, you will see the what HTML, CSS, JS, stands for. If I
        // inspect that. Now our string here has been created with abbreviation tag.
        // That is a great example of when you might want to use it. You just have to
        // tack on this addAbbreviations function and it is goingt externally go and
        // look up your dictionary.
        return strings.reduce((sentence, string, i) => {
          return `${sentence}${string}${abbreviated[i] || ''}`
        }, '');
      }

      const first = 'Karuna';
      const last = 'Sehgal';
      // I don't have a variable for HTML, CSS and JS. However I can interpolate
      // it by passing it into a string
      const sentence = addAbbreviations`My name is ${first} ${last} and I love to code ${'HTML'},
        ${'CSS'}, and ${'JS'}.`;

      const bio = document.querySelector('.bio');
      const p = document.createElement('p');
      p.innerHTML = sentence;
      bio.appendChild(p);
