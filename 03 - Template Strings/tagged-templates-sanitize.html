      // These last couple of examples I have been creating HTML and inserting it
      // right into the DOM. If you have any security background, you are probably
      // thinking that I should sanitize that data before I put it into the DOM.
      // Essentially when you get data from a user, whenever you are displaying data
      // from a user, you must make sure that the user is not trying to insert an
      // iframe or an image, or to do an XSS. Here an example. Let's assume I took
      // this first name in the aboutMe. I got that from a database or an API, or
      // something like that, and the user had this saved in their database. They
      // said I love to do even and they inserted an image to Unsplash, which is
      // allowed. You can insert an image into your bio, but they do the malicious
      // thing here where they say "onload="alert('you got hacked')", so when this
      // image loads, run this JavaScript. And that is the big no-no. You cannot let
      // your users run JavaScript on your page because then they could drain your
      // bank account, or delete your thing or post as you are there. They could do
      // anything. Imagine if you let someone run JavaScript on Facebook. You could
      // unfriend everyone, or you could look at all of their messages, or send
      // nasty messages on their behalf.
      // So here I have taken aboutMe and I just popped it into the HTML and then I set
      // it into our bio. I am taking it, putting in a refresh and I get this message.
      // You got hacked. That is called an XSS, a cross site scripting, where we let
      // someone else who inputted this data run JavaScript on our page. That's really
      // dangerous. The solution to this is to sanitize your HTML. That's another place
      // you could use the tagged template. In creating all this HTML here, I have all
      // kinds of inputs from a user. But before I put it into my HTML, it's probably
      // a good idea to run it through a sanitizer. I have loaded it in this library
      // called DOMPurify. It is a library that we use to sanitize. You can have all
      // kinds of options in here in terms of what tags are allowed and aren't allowed.
      // There are all kinds of sanitize libraries here. You could make a sanitized tag
      // template and use this library inside of it.
      // Create a function called sanitize, which is going to take in the strings and
      // values.

      function sanitize(strings, ...values) {
        // Add a reduce function. It takes in a function and what we start with,
        // and our function is going to be an arrow function that gives us the, I'm
        // going to say prev, next. Prev is what was the last iteration. Next is
        // what is the current iteration, and add an index (i). Then we are just
        // going to return a string that tacks all those things together. We got
        // prev, next, values[i] or nothing
        const dirty = strings.reduce((prev, next, i) => `${prev}${next}${values[i]
          || ''}`, '');
        return DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty);
      }

      const first = 'Wes';
      // Next you have sanitize and put it in front, tag that template. We still
      // get hacked. What we can do instead create a const variable called dirty
      // in the sanitize function and assign to the reduce functon. This string
      // is dirty becaue it still has this onload/iframe. But you can return this
      // library here called DOMPurify.sanitize and we sanitize the dirty HTML.
      // Now if you check out the browser. If we inspect the element and look at
      // the img tag, you can see that onload has been removed.
      const aboutMe = sanitize`I love to do evil <img src="http://unsplash.it/100/100?random"
      onload="alert('you got hacked');" />`;

      const html = `
        <h3>${first}</h3>
        <p>${aboutMe}</p>
      `;

      const bio = document.querySelector('.bio');
      bio.innerHTML = html;
      // Overall this was an example of how you could create a tagged template, so
      // that anytime you are creating HTML you could sanitize something.
