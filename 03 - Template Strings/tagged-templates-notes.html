      // Another feature that comes along with template literal is ability to tag
      // them: An example is running the sentence variable through a function and
      // rather than have the browser put in the variables for us, we can have
      // control over how this string is made.

      // The way a taged template works is first you make a function called
      // highlight and you take name of the function that you want to run against
      // the string and you put name of the function right in front of the template.
      // So this tagging it with a function name what is going to happen is that
      // the browser is going to run this function. It is going to provide it with all
      // the information about the string, all the pieces that the person typed as well
      // as well as the variables that get passed in and whatever we return from this
      // function is what the sentence variable is actually going to be. So it sort
      // of like a step in between. Before this function gets put into the string,
      // we have the ability to modify it in any given way.

        return 'cool';
